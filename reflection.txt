Part 3 - Partner Evaluation

Davin Chia: 9.000000000000000000001
Sherif Nada: 9

Davin's tests were thorough and diverse. He created a huge number of tests for the createVector() methods. He tested everything from positive, negative, integers, decimals, and large numbers. They uncovered problems with Sherif's code. Davin learned a lot about percision errors in the process. 

Sherif's tests were comprehensive but not redundant. They covered most edge cases and helped uncover bugs in both of our codes. 

We believe the reason we came up with a comprehensive test suite was because we had made this the topic of conversation for nearly a week, as evident by our Piazza activity. Moreover, when we combined the tests, we utilized a near even mix of both our test cases. During our meeting, we also managed to come up with a couple of test cases which we had not thought of before.
